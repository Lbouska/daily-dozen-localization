Check out the Daily Dozen’s brand new functionality! Includes 21 Tweaks from the new book, How Not to Diet.

**Description:**

Keep track of the foods recommended by Dr. Greger in his New York Times Bestselling book, How Not to Die, and now his new book, How Not to Diet.

The 21 Tweaks feature, based on How Not to Diet, also provides a weight tracker.  The weight tracker can use HealthKit to either save manually entered weight values or to read weight data from HealthKit enabled scales.

In the years of research required to create the more than a thousand evidence-based videos on his website NutritionFacts.org, Michael Greger, M.D, FACLM, has arrived at a list of what he considers the most important foods to include in a healthy daily diet. 

Dr. Greger’s Daily Dozen details the healthiest foods and how many servings of each we should try to check off every day. He explains his rationale in his book How Not to Die. 

All his proceeds from his books, DVDs, and speaking engagements are all donated to charity.

NutritionFacts.org is a non-commercial, non-profit, science-based public service provided by Dr. Greger, providing free daily updates on the latest in nutrition research via bite-sized videos. He has nearly a thousand videos on every aspect of healthy eating, with new videos and articles uploaded every day.

Like this app, everything on the website is both free of ads and free of charge.

Note: Application language selection requires iOS 13 or newer.
